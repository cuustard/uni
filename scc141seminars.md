## Seminar 1

Introduction to Term 1 Assignment (10%):

- Group report on: "What makes a good Computing professional?"
  - Section 1: What are the skills and characteristics that make a good computing professional? 400 words
  - Section 2: What are good practices for human-centred design? 400 words
  - Section 3 (Personal Reflection): Reflect on something I've learnt this term and how this relates to where I see myself in 5 years. 250 words

## Seminar 2

This seminar aims to assist in Section 1 of the group report. I need to identify and discuss computing skills of the past, present, and future.

**Guidance**: For Section 1 I **must** include a reflection on the skills of the future.

1. Past:
   - Research historically important computer scientist
   - What skills did they have and need?
   - Are these skills still required?
2. Present:
   - Search for a job I am interested in and look at the job description and personal criteria
   - What skills and characteristics stand out? Any suprises? Anything I think is missing?
   - Do my current skills match the list? Are there skills I have that are not represented?
3. Future:
   - List skills that will not be useful in 15 years time
   - List skills that will still be useful in 15 years time
   - How do I think computing skills are going to change in the future? How do I think AI is going to change computing work?

## Seminar 3

This seminar aims to assist in Section 2 of the group report. I need to identify good practices for human-centred design and what I can learn from bad design.

**Guidance**: For Section 2 I **must** include what I have learnt from at least 2 examples of bad practices.

1. Identifying Assumptions
2. Avoiding Assumptions
   - What methods could I use to gather requirements?
   - How would you design your study? What would you need to find out?
   - What baises might I need to be aware of?
3. Identifying Dark Patterns / Deceptive Design
   - What examples of this have I encountered online?
   - What do these examples teach us about good user-centered design?

## Seminar 4

This seminar we continued with the group report.

## Seminar 5

This seminar aims to assist in Section 3 of the group report. I need to reflect on something I've learnt this term (in SCC.141) and how this relates to where I see myself in 5 years. We've largely focused on understanding the best practices and have covered several topics and can identify some "cross-cutting themes".

**Guidance**: For Section 3 I **must** include a reflection on how my learning this term has shaped my understanding and future aspirations.

1. Cross-cutting themes:

   - **Computing is not just about programming**
     - Involves a range of skills
     - If I don't use all the skills, I'll end up working with people who do, so will need to be aware of them
   - **Consideration of end-users**
     - Vital to consider end-users throughout the SDLC
     - Computing is used by many people
     - People have diverse needs, desires, capabilities, and limitations
     - Systems should be accessible and have good usability
   - **Computer scientists have legal and ethical obligations**
     - Legal requirements govern behaviors
     - Ethical codes provide rules of conduct recognized by a given group
     - Best practices. Going above and beyond legal requirements

2. Being reflective involves being:

   - **Open** to different ideas, seeing things from different angles
   - **Curious** and investigatory
   - **Patient**. If the issue is not 'simple' then neither will the answer be
   - **Honest** with myself, my uncertainties, what previous assumptions I have made
   - **Rigorous**, analytical, and acting on the insights you gain

3. Being reflective helps me learn. I learn through my actions, thoughts, and experiences. I should question:

   - How has my knowledge and understanding developed over this term? Specifically in SCC.141.
   - How has my learning shaped further learning, my practice, work placement, or employment?
   - How my understanding and skills developed and changed over time.

4. To help, I should:

   - Write a list of topics that were new to me
   - Ask myself which of these topics were a surprise to me
   - Evaluate these topics and assess the importance of each within the Computing field and to myself

5. Select one or two topics and justify why I picked these topics for my reflection. Answer how my knowledge and understanding of Computing and its related areas has developed (and changed) over this term. I should support this with relevant literature (where needed).
