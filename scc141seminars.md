## Seminar 1

Introduction to Term 1 Assignment (10%):

- Group report on: "What makes a good Computing professional?"
  - Section 1: What are the skills and characteristics that make a good computing professional? 400 words
  - Section 2: What are good practices for human-centred design? 400 words
  - Section 3 (Personal Reflection): Reflect on something I've learnt this term and how this relates to where I see myself in 5 years. 250 words

## Seminar 2

This seminar aims to assist in Section 1 of the group report. I need to identify and discuss computing skills of the past, present, and future.

**Guidance**: For Section 1 I **must** include a reflection on the skills of the future.

1. Past:
   - Research historically important computer scientist
   - What skills did they have and need?
   - Are these skills still required?
2. Present:
   - Search for a job I am interested in and look at the job description and personal criteria
   - What skills and characteristics stand out? Any suprises? Anything I think is missing?
   - Do my current skills match the list? Are there skills I have that are not represented?
3. Future:
   - List skills that will not be useful in 15 years time
   - List skills that will still be useful in 15 years time
   - How do I think computing skills are going to change in the future? How do I think AI is going to change computing work?

## Seminar 3

This seminar aims to assist in Section 2 of the group report. I need to identify good practices for human-centred design and what I can learn from bad design.

**Guidance**: For Section 2 I **must** include what I have learnt from at least 2 examples of bad practices.

1. Identifying Assumptions
2. Avoiding Assumptions
   - What methods could I use to gather requirements?
   - How would you design your study? What would you need to find out?
   - What baises might I need to be aware of?
3. Identifying Dark Patterns / Deceptive Design
   - What examples of this have I encountered online?
   - What do these examples teach us about good user-centered design?

## Seminar 4

This seminar aims to assist in Section 3 of the group report. I need to reflect on something I've learnt this term (in SCC.141) and how this relates to where I see myself in 5 years. We've largely focused on understanding the best practices and have covered several topics and can identify some "cross-cutting themes".

**Guidance**: For Section 3 I **must** include a reflection on how my learning this term has shaped my understanding and future aspirations.

1. Cross-cutting themes:

   - **Computing is not just about programming**
     - Involves a range of skills
     - If I don't use all the skills, I'll end up working with people who do, so will need to be aware of them
   - **Consideration of end-users**
     - Vital to consider end-users throughout the SDLC
     - Computing is used by many people
     - People have diverse needs, desires, capabilities, and limitations
     - Systems should be accessible and have good usability
   - **Computer scientists have legal and ethical obligations**
     - Legal requirements govern behaviors
     - Ethical codes provide rules of conduct recognized by a given group
     - Best practices. Going above and beyond legal requirements

2. Being reflective involves being:

   - **Open** to different ideas, seeing things from different angles
   - **Curious** and investigatory
   - **Patient**. If the issue is not 'simple' then neither will the answer be
   - **Honest** with myself, my uncertainties, what previous assumptions I have made
   - **Rigorous**, analytical, and acting on the insights you gain

3. Being reflective helps me learn. I learn through my actions, thoughts, and experiences. I should question:

   - How has my knowledge and understanding developed over this term? Specifically in SCC.141.
   - How has my learning shaped further learning, my practice, work placement, or employment?
   - How my understanding and skills developed and changed over time.

4. To help, I should:

   - Write a list of topics that were new to me
   - Ask myself which of these topics were a surprise to me
   - Evaluate these topics and assess the importance of each within the Computing field and to myself

5. Select one or two topics and justify why I picked these topics for my reflection. Answer how my knowledge and understanding of Computing and its related areas has developed (and changed) over this term. I should support this with relevant literature (where needed).

### Research

Topic: AI changing Law

[Five Ways AI Is Shaping The Future Of Litigation Law - Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2025/01/22/five-ways-ai-is-shaping-the-future-of-litigation-law/)

> "lawyers who continue to resist embracing this shift are going to find themselves struggling."

> "Those who have already recognized the power of AI and integrated it into their practice are positioning themselves to lead in the legal field for the next decade and beyond. AI is only getting smarter and more widely accepted, and those who embrace it now will be the leaders of this new era."

> "I is a tool that can be integrated into your practice to enhance your capabilities—not replace you."

> "AI will allow us to focus more on high-value work. As it takes care of the lower-value tasks, lawyers will be able to step into a more strategic, advisory role."

> "legal professionals are utilizing generative AI for document review and contract analysis, allowing lawyers to allocate more time for higher-value, complex work." [2024 Generative AI in Professional](https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/blog/legal-professionals-see-increased-productivity-genai/#GenAIs-impact-on-the-legal-industry)

> "...organizations are starting to see cost reductions after adopting AI... By reducing overhead costs through automation across various industries, AI helps law firms expand their client base and serve people who might have once been priced out of the market."

AI is transforming litigation law by automating routine tasks, enabling lawyers to focus on strategic, high-value work and fostering a shift toward outcome-based business models. It empowers a new generation of "generalist" lawyers who can leverage AI to provide cost-effective services across diverse legal areas, expanding access to clients previously priced out of the market. While AI enhances efficiency and accuracy, it requires human oversight to avoid errors and preserve the critical elements of judgment and strategy. By embracing AI as a tool to complement their expertise, legal professionals can lead this evolving landscape, delivering better results while maintaining the irreplaceable human touch.

## Seminar 6

**Topic**: What privacy means to me.

This seminar aims to assist in Section 1 of the 2nd group report. I need to identify and discuss to what extent, and in what context, does privacy matter?. (400 words)

**Guidance notes**: You must discuss two privacy harms, each with a concrete example of how they manifest. Assess how severe you consider these harms to be and explain how they link to reasons why a person might want to protect their privacy (i.e. why privacy matters).

Today's Tasks:

1. Defining my privacy personality - 20 mins
2. Defending my privacy position - 20 mins
3. Sharing with the class - 10 mins

Develop my own position on why privacy matters to me. My position may differ from my lecturer's position; disagreement is encouraged and valued. They will assess me on my ability to articulate my own opinion.

Research:

Lean towards Dimension 1 Privacy as a Right which states that:

- Privacy laws should be strengthened to protect personal privacy.
- People need legal protection against misuse of personal data.
- If I were to write a constitution today, I would probably add privacy as a fundamental right.

## Seminar 7

**Topic**: Computing Futures

This seminar aims to assist in Section 2 of the 2nd group report. I need to identify and discuss what the key social, ethical & ethical challenges are likely to emerge over the next decade?
