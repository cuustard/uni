## Seminar 1

The aim is to encourage me to think of organizations I come across as being operations systems – as having a particular logic in the way they function, creating the problems characteristic of the operations management discipline.

I am asked to think and make conjectures about two simple, local service operations: the Greggs retail outlet on campus and the Stagecoach bus service in Lancaster. Unlike many manufacturing operations, service operations are often at least partly visible to members of the public, particularly their customers. I can see some of the functions they must perform and some of the problems they encounter. But you are also encouraged to think about what other functions must be taking place in the operation for the visible functions to be possible.

1. Purpose

   - What is their relative emphasis in each operation on objectives like cost, quality, speed, dependability, flexibility?
   - Which of these are ‘order-winning’, ‘qualifying’ or ‘other’ factors?
   - In what ways is the operation holding the firm back? making it as good as its competitors? making it the best in the industry? redefining industry expectations?

2. Transformation
   - What does each operation transform?
     - Greggs: food ingredients, packaging, hungry customers
     - Stagecoach: customers, fuel
   - What are the main transforming resources?
     - Greggs: staff, simple equipment, premises and infrastructure, basic expertise
   - What does it transform its inputs into – as main products and by-products?
     -
   - Is it a material, information or customer processor – or some combination?
   - How would you describe its variety and volume?
   - What type of operation does this variety and volume describe?
   - What are the problems in being this type of operation?
