## Seminar 1

The aim is to encourage me to think of organisations I encounter as operations systemsâ€”as having a particular logic in the way they function, creating the problems characteristic of the operations management discipline.

I am asked to think and make conjectures about two simple, local service operations: the Greggs retail outlet on campus and the Stagecoach bus service in Lancaster. Unlike many manufacturing operations, service operations are often at least partly visible to members of the public, particularly their customers. I can see some of the functions they must perform and some of the problems they encounter. But you are also encouraged to think about what other functions must take place in the operation for the visible functions to be possible.

1. Purpose

   - What is their relative emphasis in each operation on cost, quality, speed, dependability, and flexibility?
   - Which of these are â€˜order-winningâ€™, â€˜qualifyingâ€™ or â€˜otherâ€™ factors?
   - In what ways is the operation holding the firm back? Making it as good as its competitors? Making it the best in the industry? Redefining industry expectations?

2. Transformation
   - What does each operation transform?
     - Greggs: food ingredients, packaging, hungry customers
     - Stagecoach: customers, fuel
   - What are the main transforming resources?
     - Greggs: staff, simple equipment, premises and infrastructure, basic expertise
     - Stagecoach: vehicles and maintenance resources, drivers and maintenance staff
   - What does it transform its inputs into â€“ as main products and by-products?
     - Greggs: food products, less hungry customers, food waste, packaging waste
     - Stagecoach: customers in different places, pollutants, road damage, vehicle wear and damage
   - Is it a material, information or customer processor â€“ or some combination?
     - Greggs: customer and material processor
     - Stagecoach: customer and material (fuel) processor
   - How would you describe its variety and volume?
     - Greggs: moderate variety & volume so a 'service shop'
     - Stagecoach: In one sense low variety (for a given route) but in another sense high (multiplicity of routes); by intention high volume but very route dependent
   - What type of operation does this variety and volume describe?
     - Greggs: achieving insufficient volume given limits to variety or variety & volume
     - Stagecoach: probably a mass service but this obscures route heterogeneity
   - What are the problems in this type of operation?
     - Greggs: dealing with changing demand profiles - it can't ignore these (it's not a mass service) or satisfy them (it's not a professional service)
     - Stagecoach: operating a fixed schedule and route network irrespective of demand (and therefore revenue)

Characterising an operation is often unsatisfactory - objectives etc can be vague, types of transformation can be ambiguous, nature of the operation e.g. on the variety-volume scale can be unclear.

Inferences we make from this may not be very confident - is there requisite variety? Is there a reasonable trade-off between cost and variety?

But this is a necessary way to understand an operation, its role and its challenges.
