## Learning the UNIX Shell

UNIX is an Operating System developed in the 1970s. It is still being developed today, as Linux.

UNIX is a stable, multi-user, multi-tasking system for servers, desktops and laptops. Linux is UNIX with a GUI.

The Shell is a powerful extensible command line user interface that is the 'power user' interface for interacting with UNIX and the basis for most system administration on any sensible OS platform.

Linux (Ubuntu) is installed on all the lab machines in SCC's lab.
