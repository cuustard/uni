## Lecture 1 - Sets

A Set is a collection of unique and unordered objects/elements/members. E.g. `A = {4, 3, 2, 1, 5}`

### Membership

Elements in a set have a membership to that set.

For example, the element 4 is in set A. Write this as `4 ∈ A`. This means 4 'belongs to' or 'is an element of' set A.

However, the element 6 is not in set A. Write this as `6 ∉ A`. This means 6 'does not belong to' or 'is not an element of' set A.

### Defining Sets

Finite and small sets are easy to write out. For example, set A: `A = {4, 3, 2, 1, 5}` is finite with just 5 elements.

Infinite/large sets cannot be enumerated. Instead, we provide a property that all the set's elements satisfy.

For example, set B: `B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...}` and so on until infinity. To write this, we can give this set a property of x. We would say that, every element of x such that x is an integer and greater than 0. So `B = {x | P(x)}`. This means that B is the set of elements x such that x has the property P.

### Set Operations

- Union: `∪`
- Intersection: `∩`
- Difference `-`
- Cartesian Product `x`

For the following examples: `A = {1, 2, 3, 4}`, `B = {4, 5, 6}`.

Unionisation forms a new set from two sets, made of all the elements from both. Any duplicates of an element are removed. For example, `A ∪ B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`. Here we unionised two sets into one and removed duplicate element, 4, at the same time.

Intersection forms a new set from two sets, made of the elements that are common between A and B. For example, `A ∩ B = {4}`. This is because both sets have element 4, and nothing else, in common.

Difference forms a new set from two sets, made of all the elements from the first set that are not in the second set. For example. `A - B = {1, 2, 3}`.

To understand Cartesian Product, first I need to understand Ordered Pairs:

- An Ordered Pair is a pair of elements, with an order (usually ascending) associated with them
- An Ordered Pair is written as `<x, y>`. Where x and y are elements
- Two Ordered Pairs `<a, b>` and `<c, d>` are equal if `a = c` and `b = d`. This means that `<1, 2>` is not equal to `<2, 1>`

The Cartesian Product of two sets creates a set of all possible ordered pairs between the sets. For example:

```
A x B =
{
  <1, 4>, <1, 5>, <1, 6>,
  <2, 4>, <2, 5> <2, 6>,
  <3, 4>, <3, 5>, <3, 6>,
  <4, 4>, <4, 5>, <4, 6>
}
```

| A ∩ B  | Intersection      | Elements that belong to set A **and** set B                                   |

## Lecture 2 - Types of Sets

Types of sets:

- Empty
- Disjoint
- Equal
- Sets of sets
- Subsets & Proper Subsets
- Supersets & Proper Supersets
- Universal
- Complement

### Empty Sets

An empty/null/void set contains no elements. Written as `{}` or `∅`. For example `Z = {}` can also be written as `Z = ∅`.

### Disjoint Sets

Sets are disjoint if they have no elements in common (if their intersection is empty). For example, `C = {1, 2, 3}` is disjoint from `D = {4, 5, 6}`. This is because they have no common elements.

### Equal Sets

Sets are equal if they have the same elements. For example `E = {1, 2, 3}` is equal to `F = {2, 3, 1}`. Written as `C = D`. If sets are unequal use the `≠` symbol. For example, `D ≠ E`.

### Sets of Sets

Sets can contain atomic elements like letters, numbers, or a pair of elements. They can also contain other sets. For example take `A = {1, {2, 3}}`. Set `A` contains the atomic element `1`, and the set `{2, 3}`.

### Cardinality of Sets

The Cardinality of a set is the number of a set's elements. They are written as `|A|`. For example, `A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}` so `|A| = 5`. For example, `B = {1, {1, 2}, ∅, 4}` so `|B| = 4`.

### Subsets & Supersets

Set A is a subset of set B if every element of A is also an element of B. This is written as `A ⊆ B`. This would mean that if `x ∈ A`, then `x ∈ B` In some cases A could also be equal to B.

For example, if `A = {1, 2, 3}` and `B = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}` then:

- `1 ∈ A` and `1 ∈ B`
- `2 ∈ A` and `2 ∈ B`
- `3 ∈ A` and `3 ∈ B`

All of A's elements are in B so `A ⊆ B`.

This makes B a superset of A. Written `B ⊇ A`.

#### Proper Subsets & Proper Supersets

A is also a proper subset of B because B has some elements not in A. So `A ⊂ B`. This makes B a superset of A. Written as `B ⊃ A`. This also means that for a Proper Subset, `A ≠ B`.

### Universal Sets

A Universal set is a non-empty set that contains all the possible elements relevant to the solution of a given problem. Example: `U = {red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet}`.

### Complement Sets

A complement set is the difference between the universal set and a given set. Denoted by `comp(A) = U - A`. For example if `A = {red, yellow, blue}` then `comp(A) = {orange, green, indigo, violet}`.

## Lecture 3 - Relations

![Associations](images/associations.png "Diagram showing example of assocations between students and academic courses")

Pairs of objects are related in specific ways. We can represent a relationship by describing what course each student takes. Starting from the student and ending with the course. We specify the relationship this way because it is a student that takes a course; a course does not take a student.

Relations are asymmetric. The direction matters because the order of elements in the order pair matters.

The cartesian product will give us all possible ordered pairs (12 in this example). But there are only 5 relations. In real life, which students take which course could be all the possible pairs, but often it will be a subset of the cartesian product.

A binary relation is an ordered pair where two elements are brought together.

Binary Relation R from set A to set B, or over `A x B`. A set of ordered pairs `<a, b>`, `a ∈ A` and `b ∈ B`. An ordered pair `<a, b> ∈ R`. Means element a is related to element b through the relation R.

The relationship between R and A x B is as follows:

- A x B is the set of all ordered pairs (the cartesian product)
- R is a subset of `A x B`. So `R ⊆ A x B`. It is not a proper subset as R could be the cartesian product.

In the above diagram, Relation T (Takes):

- John Takes course1
  - `<John, course1> ∈ T`
- Jim Takes course1
  - `<Jim, course1> ∈ T`
- Helen Takes course2 and course3
  - `<Helen, course2> ∈ T`
  - `<Helen, course3> ∈ T`
- Mary Takes course3
  - `<Mary, course3> ∈ T`

Another example:

- `A = {0, 1, 2, 3}` and `B = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}`
- List the ordered pairs in the relation R from A to B that satisfy `<a, b> ∈ R`, if `b - a = 1`.
- `b - a = 1` is equivilant to `b = a + 1`. So `<a, b> = <a, a + 1>`:
- So the relation R looks like: `R = {<0, 1>, <1, 2>, <2, 3>, <3, 4>}`

### Logical Reasoning

- An Argument is a squence of propositions that end with a conclusion.
  - The argument is VALID if, given that the premises are true, then the conclusion is true.
- A Premise is the basis on which we esablish the conclusion.
- A Conclusion is a claim that we try to esablish as true.

Written in the form:

![Logcal Reasoning Writen Form](images/logcialReasoning.png)

### Propositional Logic

Building blocks of propositional logic:

- Atomic & Compound Propositions
- Fundamental Connectives

A rule is a function that takes propositions as premises and returns others as conclusions.

- **Inference Rules**: tamplates for building valid arguments
- **Replacement Rules**: replaces parts of propositions with logically equivalent expressions

### Inference Rules

Inference rules give methods to evaulate the validity of arguments. They highlight logical reasoning behind a valid argument are justify stemps from premises t oconclusion. An alternative to this is truth tables, but these are inconvenient with more propositions and are less intuitive.

The rules:

- Modus Ponens
- Modus Tollens
- Addition
- Simplification
- Hypothetical Syllogism
- Disjunctive Syllogism
- Absorption

• Commutative law – states that a compound proposition involving exclusively ANDs, or exclusively ORs is unaltered by reordering its atomic propositions.
• Associative law – states that a compound proposition involving exclusively ANDs or exclusively ORs, is unaltered by regrouping its atomic propositions.
• Distributive law – states that a compound proposition involving AND, OR and parentheses, is unaltered by distributing the first connective to link the first proposition separately with each proposition in the parentheses.
• De Morgan law states that the conjunction of negations is the negation of a disjunction: ~P  ~Q is equivalent to ~(P  Q).
• Absorption law states that the disjunction of any proposition P with (P ∧ Q) has the same truth value as P: P ∨ (P ∧ Q) is equivalent to P; the conjunction of any proposition P with (P ∨ Q) has the same truth value as P: P∧ (P ∨ Q) is equivalent to P.
• Identity law states that the conjunction of any proposition P with an arbitrary tautology has the same truth value as P; the disjunction of any proposition P with an arbitrary contradiction F (proposition which is always false) has the same truth value as P.
• Idempotence law states the property of a conjunction or disjunction to be applied multiple times on a proposition without changing the proposition: P ∧ P is logically equivalent to P, P ∨ P is logically equivalent to P.
• Negation law states that the disjunction of any proposition P and its negation is a tautology; the conjunction of any proposition P and its negation is a contradiction.
• Doble negation law states that any proposition P is logically equivalent to its double negation ~(~P)
• Implication law states that any implication P → Q is logically equivalent to ~P ∨ Q.
• Contraposition law states that a conditional P → Q is logically equivalent to its contrapositive (implication of negations): ~Q → ~P.
• Equivalence law states that a biconditional P  Q is logically equivalent to the conjunction of two conditionals: (P → Q)  (Q → P).
