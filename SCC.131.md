## Lecture 1 - Module Introduction & Computer Architecture

Architecture is the science of putting together building materials to produce buildings.

Computer Architecture is the science of putting together hardware to produce computers.

## Lecture 2 - Architecture & Speed

A computer is an electronic device for storing and processing data, in binary form, according to instructions given to it in a variable program.

### Computer History

- Analytical Engine
    - First computer
    - Partly built by Englishman Charles Babbage in the 19th century
    - A fully program-controlled mechanical computer
    - Consisted of the mill (calculating unit), the store, the reader, and the printer
    - Data was entered onto physical punched cards
    - Ada Lovelace wrote the first algorithm for a computer based on this machine.
- ENIAC
    - Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer was the first programmable, electronic, general-purpose digital computer
    - Built during WW2 in the USA
    - Programmed via switches and cables
- Manchester SSEM
    - Small-Scale Experimental Machine was the first electronic stored-program computer
    - Built-in the Uni of Manchester
- Cambridge EDSAC
    - Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator
    - Built at Cambridge Uni
    - First practical stored-program computer in regular use
    - Used punched cards to load programs
- IBM Personal Computer
    - Released 1981
    - Led to the era of cheap commodity-based computation

Computer Architecture is rules and methods that describe the functionality, organisation, and implementation of computer systems which can be applied at many levels such as processor, memory, and instruction sets.

### Von Neumman

- Memory that stores, data & instructions together
- A Control Unit (CU) that contains an instruction register and Program Counter (PC)
- Processing unit that contains Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and processor Registers
- Input & Output mechanisms

![Von Neumman Architecture](images/VonNeummanDiagram.png "Diagram of Von Neumman")

CPU contains

- ALU + CU and Cache Memory
- Logically the same as the above diagram

![Von Neumman Architecture](images/VonNeummanDiagram2.png "Diagram of Von Neumman")

### Harvard

Instructions and data are stored in separate memories to overcome the bottleneck of Von Neumman. This allows parallel access to data and instruction so this can be faster.

![Harvard Architecture](images/harvradDiagram.png "Diagram of Harvard")

Modified Harvard:

- Separates instructions and data caches internally but a single main memory is visible to programs.

![Harvard Architecture](images/harvradDiagram2.png "Diagram of Harvard")

### Modern Architecture

![Modern Architecture Diagram](images/modernArchitecture.png "Diagram of Harvard")

### Speed Factors & Limitations

Computer speed metrics:

- Clock Rate
    - 3GHz processor makes 3 billion ticks per second
    - instructions take different numbers of ticks so bad
- Millions of Instructions Per Second (MIPS)
    - Better than previous but depends on which instructions are counted (number of instructions)
    - Different Results for programs
- Floating Point Operations Per Second (FLOPS)
    - Better indication of speed where it counts

Density Limitations

- number of transistors per square inch
- Moore's Law

## Lecture 3 - Information Coding

Computer hardware should be as simple as possible due to cost, performance, and scalability factors. Because of this, we focus on handling small, positive integers. Any other data type is a code/representation that maps to positive integers.

### ASCII

The American Standard Code for Information Interchange is a 7-bit binary (2<sup>7</sup>) code for characters.

![ASCII Table](images/ASCIItable.png "ASCII Table")

In practice, we use numbers such as negatives, fractions, floating-points, etc. But all of these map to small, positive whole numbers held in memory.

### Decimal in Base-10

Representing 1984:

| Thousands (10<sup>3</sup>)  | Hundreds ((10<sup>2</sup>)) | Tens ((10<sup>1</sup>))  | Units/Ones (10<sup>0</sup>)  |
| :-------------------------: | :-------------------------: | :----------------------: | :--------------------------: |
|    1 \* 10<sup>3</sup>      |     9 \* 10<sup>2</sup>     |   8 \* 10<sup>1</sup>    |     4 \* 10<sup>0</sup>      |
|         1 \* 1000           |          9 \* 100           |         8 \* 10          |           4 \* 1             |
|            1000             |             900             |           80             |              4               |

1000 + 900 + 80 + 4 = 1984.

### Multiplication and Division

1984 \* 10 = 19840

Multiplying a number by 10<sup>n</sup> shifts the number left by n decimal places, feeding in 0's on the right.

Dividing a number by 10<sup>n</sup> shifts the number right by n decimal places.

### Negative Numbers

There are 3 coding approaches for negative numbers:

- Sign and Magnitude
- Excess N
- Twos Complement

## Lecture 9 - Building Memory

Memory stores bits. Volatile memory is a type of memory that maintains its data only while there is power. There are 2 types of Volatile Memory:

- Dynamic Memory
    - Used for Main Memory
    - Slower, Cheaper
- Static Memory
    - Used for Registers & Cache
    - Faster, more expensive

![The Memory Heirarchy](images/memoryHeirarchy.png "Diagram of Memory Heirarchy")

Memory is made of locations, each of which holds one unit of data. Each location has an address.

![Abstracted Main Memory Diagram](images/abstractedMainMemory.png "Abstracted Main Memory Diagram")

### Address Decoding

An address decoder maps from a linear address to a specific memory location in a specific memory chip.

![Address Decoding](images/addressDecoding.png "Diagram Showing The Process of Address Decoding")

### Byte Ordering in Multi-Byte words

Different machine architectures may organise multi-byte words differently in memory. There are 2 ways:

- Big-endian
    - Within a multi-byte word, the location with the lowest memory address holds the **most**-significant-byte
- Little-endian
    - Within a multi-byte word, the location with the lowest memory address holds the **least**-significant-byte

### Static Memory

Stored bits are organised into multi-bit storage slots called registers. Networks of logic components are used to build storage for individual data bits.

### Combinatorial Logic

- Combinatorial Logic: Output is a function of its input.
- Sequential Logic: Output is a function of its input AND its current outputs.
    - So the output is fed into the inputs. Feedback loop.

### Sequential Logic & S-R Flip-Flop

The S-R Flip-Flop 'remembers' which of the 2 possible stats it is in.

- Q<sub>0</sub> represents the current state
- Q represents the next state.
    - Q depends on the inputs S & R.

![S-R Flip-Flop](images/SRflipFlip.png "Diagram showing Logic Circuits of SR Flip Flop")

EXPLAIN IT HERE

Has several limitations:

- It's got distinct SET and RESET inputs
    - It's better to have one single input that 'sets' the state if 1, and 'resets' the state if 0
- There is no way of telling the flip-flop when it should store input data
    - It's better to have a 'latch' signal for this to work in a practical system with a control unit
