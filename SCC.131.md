## Lecture 2 - Architecture & Speed

A computer is an electronic device for storing and processing data, in binary form, according to instructions given to it in a variable program.

### Computer History

- Analytical Engine
  - First computer
  - Partly built by Englishman Charles Babbage in the 19th century
  - A fully program-controlled mechanical computer
  - Consisted of the mill (calculating unit), the store, the reader, and the printer
  - Data was entered onto physical punched cards
  - Ada Lovelace wrote the first algorithm for a computer based on this machine.
- ENIAC
  - Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer was the first programmable, electronic, general-purpose digital computer
  - Built during WW2 in the USA
  - Programmed via switches and cables
- Manchester SSEM
  - Small-Scale Experimental Machine was the first electronic stored-program computer
  - Built-in the Uni of Manchester
- Cambridge EDSAC
  - Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator
  - Built at Cambridge Uni
  - First practical stored-program computer in regular use
  - Used punched cards to load programs
- IBM Personal Computer
  - Released 1981
  - Led to the era of cheap commodity-based computation

Computer Architecture is rules and methods that describe the functionality, organisation, and implementation of computer systems which can be applied at many levels such as processor, memory, and instruction sets.

### Von Neumman

- Memory that stores, data & instructions together
- A Control Unit (CU) that contains an instruction register and Program Counter (PC)
- Processing unit that contains Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) and processor Registers
- Input & Output mechanisms

![Von Neumman Architecture](images/VonNeummanDiagram.png "Diagram of Von Neumman")

CPU contains

- ALU + CU and Cache Memory
- Logically the same as the above diagram

![Von Neumman Architecture](images/VonNeummanDiagram2.png "Diagram of Von Neumman")

### Harvard

Instructions and data are stored in separate memories to overcome the bottleneck of Von Neumman. This allows parallel access to data and instruction so this can be faster.

![Harvard Architecture](images/harvradDiagram.png "Diagram of Harvard")

Modified Harvard:

- Separates instructions and data caches internally but a single main memory is visible to programs.

![Harvard Architecture](images/harvradDiagram2.png "Diagram of Harvard")

### Modern Architecture

![Modern Architecture Diagram](images/modernArchitecture.png "Diagram of Harvard")

### Speed Factors & Limitations

Computer speed metrics:

- Clock Rate
  - 3GHz processor makes 3 billion ticks per second
  - instructions take different numbers of ticks so bad
- Millions of Instructions Per Second (MIPS)
  - Better than previous but depends on which instructions are counted (number of instructions)
  - Different Results for programs
- Floating Point Operations Per Second (FLOPS)
  - Better indication of speed where it counts

Density Limitations

- number of transistors per square inch
- Moore's Law

## Lecture 3 - Information Coding

Computer hardware should be as simple as possible due to cost, performance, and scalability factors. Because of this, we focus on handling small, positive integers. Any other data type is a code/representation that maps to positive integers.

### ASCII

The American Standard Code for Information Interchange is a 7-bit binary (2<sup>7</sup>) code for characters.

![ASCII Table](images/ASCIItable.png "ASCII Table")

In practice, we use numbers such as negatives, fractions, floating-points, etc. But all of these map to small, positive whole numbers held in memory.

### Decimal in Base-10

Representing 1984:

| Thousands (10<sup>3</sup>) | Hundreds ((10<sup>2</sup>)) | Tens ((10<sup>1</sup>)) | Units/Ones (10<sup>0</sup>) |
| :------------------------: | :-------------------------: | :---------------------: | :-------------------------: |
|    1 \* 10<sup>3</sup>     |     9 \* 10<sup>2</sup>     |   8 \* 10<sup>1</sup>   |     4 \* 10<sup>0</sup>     |
|         1 \* 1000          |          9 \* 100           |         8 \* 10         |           4 \* 1            |
|            1000            |             900             |           80            |              4              |

1000 + 900 + 80 + 4 = 1984.

### Multiplication and Division

1984 \* 10 = 19840

Multiplying a number by 10<sup>n</sup> shifts the number left by n decimal places, feeding in 0's on the right.

Dividing a number by 10<sup>n</sup> shifts the number right by n decimal places.

### Negative Numbers

There are 3 coding approaches for negative numbers:

- Sign and Magnitude
- Excess N
- Twos Complement

#### Sign and Magnitude

Binary number split into a sign-bit and the magnitude. The sign-bit indicates whether the value is positive or negative. For example. The following decomal numbers are represented in 8bit-binary using Sign and Magnitude:

- +6 = 00000110
- -6 = 10000110

#### Excess N

MSB used to represent an excess. Example:

1. Code the decimal 20 using excess 127:

   - Take the value 20 and add 127 to it: `20 + 127 = 147`.
   - Encode 147 into binary: `147` in binary is `10010011`.
   - This is the excess 127 representation of 20.

2. To convert back:

   - Take the excess 127 binary representation `10010011` and convert it back to decimal: `10010011` in decimal is `147`.
   - Subtract the excess 127: `147 - 127 = 20`.

Another Example:

3. Code the decimal -20 using excess 127:

   - Take the value -20 and add 127 to it: `-20 + 127 = 107`.
   - Encode 107 into binary: `107` in binary is `01101011`.
   - This is the excess 127 representation of -20.

4. To convert back:
   - Take the excess 127 binary representation `01101011` and convert it back to decimal: `01101011` in decimal is `107`.
   - Subtract the excess 127: `107 - 127 = -20`.

To determine excess N value, we use half of the maximum possible value as a buffer. For example, if the max value is 100, the excess is 50; if it's 10,000, the excess is 5,000. This "half-rule" provides a safe margin without setting limits too close to the maximum.

Rule in action: If given the decimal 2,976, the max number is 10,000. 10,000/2 = 5,000. So could expect to encode in Excess 5000.

## Lecture 9 - Building Memory

Memory stores bits. Volatile memory is a type of memory that maintains its data only while there is power. There are 2 types of Volatile Memory:

- Dynamic Memory
  - Used for Main Memory
  - Slower, Cheaper
- Static Memory
  - Used for Registers & Cache
  - Faster, more expensive

![The Memory Heirarchy](images/memoryHeirarchy.png "Diagram of Memory Heirarchy")

Memory is made of locations, each of which holds one unit of data. Each location has an address.

![Abstracted Main Memory Diagram](images/abstractedMainMemory.png "Abstracted Main Memory Diagram")

### Address Decoding

An address decoder maps from a linear address to a specific memory location in a specific memory chip.

![Address Decoding](images/addressDecoding.png "Diagram Showing The Process of Address Decoding")

### Byte Ordering in Multi-Byte words

Different machine architectures may organise multi-byte words differently in memory. There are 2 ways:

- Big-endian
  - Within a multi-byte word, the location with the lowest memory address holds the **most**-significant-byte
- Little-endian
  - Within a multi-byte word, the location with the lowest memory address holds the **least**-significant-byte

### Static Memory

Stored bits are organised into multi-bit storage slots called registers. Networks of logic components are used to build storage for individual data bits.

### Combinatorial Logic

- Combinatorial Logic: Output is a function of its input.
- Sequential Logic: Output is a function of its input AND its current outputs.
  - So the output is fed into the inputs. Feedback loop.

### Sequential Logic & S-R Flip-Flop

The S-R Flip-Flop 'remembers' which of the 2 possible stats it is in.

- Q<sub>0</sub> represents the current state
- Q represents the next state.
  - Q depends on the inputs S & R.

![S-R Flip-Flop](images/SRflipFlip.png "Diagram showing Logic Circuits of SR Flip Flop")

EXPLAIN IT HERE

Has several limitations:

- It's got distinct SET and RESET inputs
  - It's better to have one single input that 'sets' the state if 1, and 'resets' the state if 0
- There is no way of telling the flip-flop when it should store input data
  - It's better to have a 'latch' signal for this to work in a practical system with a control unit

## Lecture 11 - Building the Input/Output System

The Input/Output system enables I/O devices to connect to the processor.

Input Devices:

- keyboard
- mouse
- trackpad
- camera
- other sensor

Output devices:

- Monitor
- Printer
- Speakers
- Actuators

Input AND Output devices:

- Network Interfaces - ethernet, wifi, bluetooth
- disks
- audio cards
- MIDI devices

I/O Challenges:

1. The Speed-Gap

- I/O devices are mechanical so run massively slower compared to the CPU

2. The Device Diversity

- Diversity of data-access modes
  - read-only, or write-only, or read-and-write
  - Access by the induvidual byte or by the block/by the stream
  - Access randomly (like a disk) or sequentially (like a tape)
- Device-specific Operations
  - change for resolution, set the time, focus
- I/O protocol
  - potential data transfer errors
  - synchronous or asynchronous

Device drivers are software plug-ins inside the operating system.

Karnaugh Maps

### Fetch Decode Execute Cycle

All the CPU does is repeate the process of fetching the next instruction, decoding it, and executing it.

### Registers

A register is a holding place for data being worked on in the CPU. They are much faster than main memory.

There are general prupose and special registers. Registers used by arithmetic & logic instructions are general purpose.

Special:

- PC (program counter)
- SP (stack pointer)

### ALU

- half adders and full adders work.
- ripple-carry - carry select adders
- the status and the overflow flag
- bit shifting left and right

### Memory

- Dynamic vs Static Memory
- Memory Address Decoding
- Combinatorial vs Sequential Logic
- SR Flip Flip

### The Control Unit

A 'little program' that endlessly executes the FDE cycle.

### Pipelining

Improves performance by exploiting inherent parallelism inside the control unit to speed up the FDE Cycle.
