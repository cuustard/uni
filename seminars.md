## Seminar 1

Introduction to Term 1 Assignment (10%):

- Group report on: "What makes a good Computing professional?"
   - Section 1: What are the skills and characteristics that make a good computing professional? 400 words
   - Section 2: What are good practices for human-centred design? 400 words
   - Section 3 (Personal Reflection): Reflect on something I've learnt this term and how this relates to where I see myself in 5 years. 250 words

## Seminar 2

This seminar aims to assist in Section 1 of the group report. I need to identify and discuss computing skills of the past, present, and future.

**Guidance**: For Section 1 I **must** include a reflection on the skills of the future.

1. Past:
   - Research historically important computer scientist
   - What skills did they have and need?
   - Are these skills still required?
2. Present:
   - Search for a job I am interested in and look at the job description and personal criteria
   - What skills and characteristics stand out? Any suprises? Anything I think is missing?
   - Do my current skills match the list? Are there skills I have that are not represented?
3. Future:
   - List skills that will not be useful in 15 years time
   - List skills that will still be useful in 15 years time
   - How do I think computing skills are going to change in the future? How do I think AI is going to change computing work?

## Seminar 3

This seminar aims to assist in Section 2 of the group report. I need to identify good practices for human-centred design and what I can learn from bad design.

**Guidance**: For Section 2 I **must** include what I have learnt from at least 2 examples of bad practices.

1. Identifying Assumptions
2. Avoiding Assumptions
   - What methods could I use to gather requirements?
   - How would you design your study? What would you need to find out?
   - What baises might I need to be aware of?
3. Identifying Dark Patterns / Deceptive Design
   - What examples of this have I encountered online?
   - What do these examples teach us about good user-centered design?
